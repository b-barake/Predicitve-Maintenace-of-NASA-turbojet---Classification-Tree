# Predicitve-Maintenace-of-NASA-turbojet---Classification-Tree
This project, inspired by an earlier work on Predictive Maintenance using LSTM, employs a Decision Tree Classification Model to predict the remaining useful life of aircraft engines. Using simulated sensor data from gas turbine engines, the model seeks to optimize maintenance scheduling to minimize unexpected failures.
